# Contract Verification

Contract verification refers to the process of auditing and verifying the code of smart contracts before they are deployed on the blockchain. This is an important step in ensuring that smart contracts function as intended and are free of vulnerabilities or security flaws.

It is typically performed by independent auditors, security experts, or automated tools. The process involves a thorough analysis of the contract code to identify potential issues, such as bugs, security vulnerabilities, or potential attacks. This can involve both manual and automated testing to ensure that the code meets certain standards and best practices.
