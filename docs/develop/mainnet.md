# Mainnet

import { chainConfig, handler } from '@site/src/utils/ChainConfig';

The Qubetics Mainnet is a decentralized blockchain network.
It allows developers to test and deploy their decentralized applications (dApps)
in a safe and secure environment without the risk of losing real funds.
It is run by Validators using the same software as on the Qubetics Mainnet,
which means it is built using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
and supports the Ethereum toolchain.
This makes it compatible with a vast ecosystem
of existing Ethereum-based applications and tools.

Using the Qubetics mainnet provides several benefits for dApp developers.
Firstly, it enables them to test and refine their smart contracts
and dApps in a sandbox environment without the risk of making costly mistakes.
Developers can experiment with different use cases and scenarios,
simulate various network conditions,
and stress test their applications to ensure they are scalable and resilient.
Secondly, the Qubetics mainnet provides a community-driven
and collaborative platform for developers to share knowledge, best practices, and code.
This can help developers to speed up their development process
and tap into a wealth of resources and expertise.
