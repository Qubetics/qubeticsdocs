# Qubetics CLI

`qubeticsd` is the all-in-one command-line interface (CLI). It allows you to run an Qubetics node, manage wallets and interact
 with the Qubetics network through queries and transactions. This introduction will explain how to install the `qubeticsd`
 binary onto your system and guide you through some simple examples how to use qubeticsd.

## Prerequisites

#### Go

Qubetics is built using [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) version `1.20+`. Check your version with:

```bash
go version
```

Once you have installed the right version, confirm that your [`GOPATH`](https://golang.org/doc/gopath_code#GOPATH)
 is correctly configured by running the following command and adding it to your shell startup script:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

#### jq

Qubetics scripts are using [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) version `1.6+`. Check your version with:

```
jq --version
```

## Installation

You can download the latest testnet binaries from the repo and install them.


### Download the mainnet binaries

- Go to the [releases section of the repository](https://github.com/Qubetics/qubetics-mainnetnode-script)
- Clone the repository
- Extract the files.


### Download the testnet binaries

- Go to the [releases section of the repository](https://github.com/Qubetics/qubetics-testnet-script)
- Clone the repository
- Extract the files.


After installation is done, check that the `qubeticsd` binaries have been successfully installed:

```bash
qubeticsd
```

:::info
If the `qubeticsd: command not found` error message is returned, confirm that you have configured [Go](#go) correctly.

## Sync a Mainnet QUbetics node
To become familiar with Qubetics, you can sync a qubetics mainnet blockchain node that produces blocks and exposes EVM and Cosmos
endpoints. This allows you to deploy and interact with smart contracts locally or test core protocol functionality.

Sync a qubetics mainnet blockchain node by executing the script in the base directory of the repository:

```bash
 ./qubetics_ubuntu_node.sh (it's for ubuntu os) 
```
:::info
Right Now qubetics binary is only for ubuntu22.04 and ubuntu 24.04
:::

```bash
 ./qubetics_mac_node.sh (it's for mac os) 
```
:::info
Right Now qubetics binary is only for Mac14 and MacOS15
:::

## Sync a Testnet Qubetics node

To become familiar with Qubetics, you can sync a qubetics testnet blockchain node that produces blocks and exposes EVM and Cosmos
endpoints. This allows you to deploy and interact with smart contracts locally or test core protocol functionality.

Sync a qubetics testnet blockchain node by executing the script in the base directory of the repository:

```bash
 ./qubetics_ubuntu_node.sh (it's for ubuntu os) 
```
:::info
Right Now qubetics binary is only for ubuntu20.04, ubuntu 22.04 and macOSVentura13
:::

The script stores the node configuration including the local default endpoints under `~/.tmp-qubeticsd/config/config.toml`.
If you have previously run the script, the script allows you to overwrite the existing configuration and start a new
local node.

Once your node is running you will see it syncing with testnet of qubetics and producing blocks in your local qubetics blockchain:

```bash
12:59PM INF executed block height=1 module=state num_invalid_txs=0 num_valid_txs=0 server=node
# ...
1:00PM INF indexed block exents height=7 module=txindex server=node
```


## Using `qubeticsd`

After installing the `qubeticsd` binary, you can run commands using:

```bash
qubeticsd [command]
```

There is also a `-h`, `--help` command available

```bash
qubeticsd -h
```

It is possible to maintain multiple node configurations at the same time. To specify a configuration use the `--home`
flag. In the following examples we will be using the default config for a local node, located at `~/.tmp-qubeticsd`.

### Manage wallets

You can manage your wallets using the qubeticsd binary to store private keys and sign transactions over CLI. To view all
keys use:

```bash
qubeticsd keys list \
--home ~/.tmp-qubeticsd \
--keyring-backend test

# Example Output:
# - address: qubetics16dh50k9twtjzkee0ld5auyy949cdn23c3gacq4
#   name: dev0
#   pubkey: '{"@type":"/ethermint.crypto.v1.ethsecp256k1.PubKey","key":"A9/aJHMclvZ1yqGroC2TC80vHL8CwWYxcZE71cD3u6Sl"}'
#   type: local
```

You can generate a new key/mnemonic with a `$NAME` with:

```bash
qubeticsd keys add [name] \
--home ~/.tmp-qubeticsd \
--keyring-backend test
```

To export your qubetics key as an Ethereum private key

```bash
qubeticsd keys unsafe-export-eth-key [name] \
--home ~/.tmp-qubeticsd \
--keyring-backend test
```

For more about the available key commands, use the `--help` flag

```bash
qubeticsd keys -h
```

### Interact with a Network

You can use qubeticsd to query information or submit transactions on the blockchain. Queries and transactions are requests
 that you send to an Qubetics node through the Tendermint RPC.

:::tip
ðŸ‘‰ To use the CLI, you will need to provide a Tendermint RPC address for the `--node` flag.
Look for a publicly available addresses for testnet and mainnet in the [Networks](./../../develop/api/networks) page.
:::

#### Set Network Config

In the local setup the node is set to `tcp://0.0.0.0:26657`. You can view your node configuration with:

```bash
qubeticsd config \
--home ~/.tmp-qubeticsd
# Example Output
# {
# 	"chain-id": "qubetics_9029-1",
# 	"keyring-backend": "test",
# 	"output": "text",
# 	"node": "tcp://0.0.0.0:26657",
# 	"broadcast-mode": "sync"
# }
```

You can set your node configuration to send requests to a different network by changing the endpoint with:

```bash
qubeticsd config node [tendermint-rpc-endpoint] \
--home ~/.tmp-qubeticsd
```

Learn about more node configurations [here](configuration.mdx).

#### Queries

You can query information on the blockchain using `qubeticsd query` (short `qubeticsd q`). To view the account balances by its
 address stored in the bank module, use:

```bash
qubeticsd q bank balances [adress] \
--home ~/.tmp-qubeticsd
# # Example Output:
# balances:
# - amount: "1119900000000000000000289"
#   denom: tics
```

To view other available query commands, use:

```bash
# for all Queries
qubeticsd q

# for querying commands in the bank module
qubeticsd q bank
```

#### Transactions

You can submit transactions to the network using `qubeticsd tx`. This creates, signs and broadcasts a tx in one command. To
 send tokens from an account in the keyring to another address with the bank module, use:

```bash
qubeticsd tx bank send [from_key_or_address] [to_address] [amount] \
--home ~/.tmp-qubeticsd \
--fees 20000000000000000tics \
-b block

# Example Output:
# ...
# txhash: 7BA2618295B789CC24BB13E654D9187CDD264F61FC446EB756EAC07AF3E7C40A
```

To view other available transaction commands, use:

```bash
# for all transaction commands
qubeticsd tx

# for Bank transaction subcommands
qubeticsd tx bank
```

Now that you've learned the basics of how to run and interact with an qubetics network,
head over to [configurations](configuration.mdx) for futher customization.
