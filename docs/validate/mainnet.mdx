# Mainnet


import ProjectValue from '@site/src/components/ProjectValue';
import Highlighter from '@site/src/components/Highlighter';

This document outlines the steps to join an existing mainnet.

## Mainnet

You specify the network you want to join by setting the **genesis file** and **seeds**. If you need more information about past networks, check our [mainnet node sync repo](https://github.com/Qubetics/qubetics-mainnetnode-script).

| Mainnet Chain ID | Description                       | Site                                                                       |  Status  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |  ------- |
| `qubetics_9030-1`   | qubetics_9030-1 mainnet              | [Qubetics 9030-1](https://github.com/Qubetics/qubetics-mainnetnode-script)    |  `Live`  |

## Server Timezone Configuration

Make sure your server **timezone configuration is UTC**.
To know what is your current timezone, run the `timedatectl` command.

:::danger
ðŸš¨ **DANGER**: Having a different timezone configuration
may cause a `LastResultsHash` mismatch error.
This will take down your node!
:::

## Install `qubeticsd`

Follow the [installation](./../protocol/qubetics-cli/) document to install the <ProjectValue keyword='name' /> binary <Highlighter keyword="binary" />.

:::warning
Make sure you have the right version of <Highlighter keyword="binary" /> installed.
:::

### Save Chain ID

We recommend saving the mainnet `chain-id` into your <Highlighter keyword="binary" />'s
`client.toml`. This will make it so you do not have to manually pass in the `chain-id` flag for every CLI command.

:::tip
See the Official [Chain IDs](./../protocol/concepts/chain-id#official-chain-ids) for reference.
:::

```bash
qubeticsd config chain-id qubetics_9030-1
```


## Installation

You can download the latest binaries from the repo and install them.

### Download the binaries

- Go to the [releases section of the repository](https://github.com/Qubetics/qubetics-mainnetnode-script)
- Clone the repository
- Extract the files.

After installation is done, check that the `qubeticsd` binaries have been successfully installed:

```bash
qubeticsd version
```

:::info
If the `qubeticsd: command not found` error message is returned, confirm that you have configured [Go](#go) correctly.

## Automated Sync a mainnet Qubetics node with first block

To become familiar with Qubetics, you can sync a qubetics mainnet blockchain node that produces blocks and exposes EVM and Cosmos
endpoints. This allows you to deploy and interact with smart contracts locally or test core protocol functionality.

Sync a qubetics mainnet blockchain node by executing the script in the base directory of the repository:

```bash
 ./qubetics_ubuntu_node.sh (it is for ubuntu os)
 ./qubetics_mac_node.sh (it is for mac os)
```
 After this clone the repository with the [upgraded-binary](https://github.com/Qubetics/qubetics-mainnet-upgrade)

 We had updated the 20% fee burn adn 80% goes to community pool, so this script will download the upgraded binary and automatically run the chain after the upgrade height."
 Version v1.0.2 binaries
 The chain will get upgraded once it reaches the height of 780000. Clone the repository and change into the directory.
```bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/Qubetics/qubetics-upgrade-v1.0.2 
Now run the below command

Copy
cd qubetics-upgrade-v1.0.2/
./upgrade_qubetics_node.sh
```
 

  We had updated the fee and reward changes, so this script will download the upgraded binary and automatically run the chain after the upgrade height."
 Version v1.0.1 binaries
 The chain will get upgraded. Clone the repository and change into the directory.
```bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/Qubetics/qubetics-mainnet-upgrade 
Now run the below command

Copy
cd qubetics-mainnet-upgrade/
./upgrade_qubetics_node.sh
```

:::info
Right Now qubetics binary is only for ubuntu20.04,ubuntu22.04 and ubuntu 24.04
:::




The script stores the node configuration including the local default endpoints under `~/.tmp-qubeticsd/config/config.toml`.
If you have previously run the script, the script allows you to overwrite the existing configuration and start a new
local node.

Once your node is running you will see it syncing with mainnet of qubetics and producing blocks in your local Qubetics blockchain:

```bash
12:59PM INF executed block height=1 module=state num_invalid_txs=0 num_valid_txs=0 server=node
# ...
1:00PM INF indexed block exents height=7 module=txindex server=node
```





## Mannually Initialize Mainnet Node

We need to initialize the node to create all the necessary validator and node configuration files:

```bash
qubeticsd init <your_custom_moniker> --chain-id qubetics_9030-1
```

:::danger
Monikers can contain only ASCII characters. Using Unicode characters will render your node unreachable.
:::

By default, the `init` command creates your `~/.qubeticsd` (i.e `$HOME`) directory with subfolders `config/` and `data/`.
In the `config` directory, the most important files for configuration are `app.toml` and `config.toml`.

## Genesis & Seeds

### Copy the Genesis File

Check the `genesis.json` file from the [`archive`](https://github.com/Qubetics/qubetics-mainnetnode-script/blob/main/genesis.json)
 and copy it over to the `config` directory: `~/.tmp-qubeticsd/config/genesis.json`. This is
 a genesis file with the chain-id and genesis accounts balances.

```bash
sudo apt install -y unzip wget
```

Then verify the correctness of the genesis configuration file:

```bash
qubeticsd validate-genesis
```

### Add Persistent Peers

We can set the [`persistent_peers`](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/tendermint-core/using-tendermint.html#persistent-peer) field in `~/.tmp-qubeticsd/config/config.toml` to specify peers that your node will maintain persistent
 connections with. You can retrieve them from the list of
available peers on the [`mainnet`](https://github.com/Qubetics/qubetics-mainnetnode-script/main/qubetics_ubuntu_node.sh) repo.

A list of available persistent peers is also available in the `#find-peers`. You can get a random 10 entries from the `peers.txt`
 file in the `PEERS` variable by running the following command:

```bash
PEERS=`ad8e2053470a347d87f5125d54fe04d86155f7c4@159.138.134.250:26656,1cb538b9950c4f3ce89848101e6698bbf68ad40c@150.40.237.123:26656,41f8e8b5479374a21e69be09911a0c0dc6f41b23@49.0.247.123:26656`
```

Use `sed` to include them into the configuration. You can also add them manually:

```bash
sed -i.bak -e "s/^persistent_peers *=.*/persistent_peers = \"$PEERS\"/" ~/.tmp-qubeticsd/config/config.toml
```

## Run a Mainnet Validator

We have created a validator and delegator app so you can easily setup a validator and delegator node. Here is the link of our validator and delegator web app.

:::tip
[Valdiator web app](https://validator.qubetics.com/)

[Delegator web app](https://delegator.qubetics.com/)
:::


## Start node

The final step is to [start the nodes](./../protocol/qubetics-cli/).
Once enough voting power (+2/3) from the genesis validators is up-and-running, the
mainnet will start producing blocks.


## Upgrading Your Node

:::tip
These instructions are for full nodes that have ran on previous versions of and would like to upgrade to the latest
 mainnet version.
:::

### Reset Data

:::warning
If the version `<new_version>` you are upgrading to is not breaking from the previous one, you **should not** reset
the data. If this is the case you can skip to [Restart](#restart)
:::

First, remove the outdated files and reset the data.

```bash
rm $HOME/.tmp-qubeticsd/config/addrbook.json $HOME/.tmp-qubeticsd/config/genesis.json
qubeticsd tendermint unsafe-reset-all --home $HOME/.tmp-qubeticsd
```

Your node is now in a pristine state while keeping the original `priv_validator.json` and `config.toml`. If you had
 any sentry nodes or full nodes setup before,
your node will still try to connect to them, but may fail if they haven't also
been upgraded.

:::danger Warning
Make sure that every node has a unique `priv_validator.json`. Do not copy the `priv_validator.json`
from an old node to multiple new nodes. Running two nodes with the same `priv_validator.json`
will cause you to double sign.
:::

### Restart

To restart your node, just type:

```bash
qubeticsd start
```

## Share your Peer

:::tip
To get your Node ID use

```bash
qubeticsd tendermint show-node-id
```
