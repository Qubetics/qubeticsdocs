# Testnet

import ProjectValue from '@site/src/components/ProjectValue';
import Highlighter from '@site/src/components/Highlighter';

This document outlines the steps to join an existing testnet.

## Pick a Testnet

You specify the network you want to join by setting the **genesis file** and **seeds**. If you need more information about past networks, check our [testnets repo](https://github.com/Qubetics/qubetics-testnet-script).

| Testnet Chain ID | Description                       | Site                                                                       |  Status  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |  ------- |
| `qubetics_9029-1`   | qubetics_9029-1 Testnet              | [qubetics 9029-1](https://github.com/Qubetics/qubetics-testnet-script)    |  `Live`  |

## Server Timezone Configuration

Make sure your server **timezone configuration is UTC**.
To know what is your current timezone, run the `timedatectl` command.

:::danger
ðŸš¨ **DANGER**: Having a different timezone configuration
may cause a `LastResultsHash` mismatch error.
This will take down your node!
:::

## Install `qubeticsd`

Follow the [installation](./../protocol/qubetics-cli/) document to install the <ProjectValue keyword='name' /> binary <Highlighter keyword="binary" />.

:::warning
Make sure you have the right version of <Highlighter keyword="binary" /> installed.
:::

### Save Chain ID

We recommend saving the testnet `chain-id` into your <Highlighter keyword="binary" />'s
`client.toml`. This will make it so you do not have to manually pass in the `chain-id` flag for every CLI command.

:::tip
See the Official [Chain IDs](./../protocol/concepts/chain-id#official-chain-ids) for reference.
:::

```bash
qubeticsd config chain-id qubetics_9029-1
```


## Installation

You can download the latest binaries from the repo and install them.

### Download the binaries

- Go to the [releases section of the repository](https://github.com/Qubetics/qubetics-testnet-script)
- Clone the repository
- Extract the files.

After installation is done, check that the `qubeticsd` binaries have been successfully installed:

```bash
qubeticsd version
```

:::info
If the `qubeticsd: command not found` error message is returned, confirm that you have configured [Go](#go) correctly.
:::

## Run a Node Locally use these Qubetics binary
-  [Ubuntu22.04](https://github.com/Qubetics/qubetics-testnet-script/tree/main/ubuntu20.04build)
-  [Ubuntu24.04](https://github.com/Qubetics/qubetics-testnet-script/tree/main/ubuntu22.04build)

:::info
` Ubuntu`

Copy the `qubeticsd` binary and Paste it inside `/usr/local/bin` folder.


` Mac`

Copy the `qubeticsd` binary and Paste it inside `$HOME/go/bin`
:::

## Automated Sync a Testnet Qubeticsd node

To become familiar with qubetics, you can sync a qubetics testnet blockchain node that produces blocks and exposes EVM and Cosmos
endpoints. This allows you to deploy and interact with smart contracts locally or test core protocol functionality.

Sync a qubetics testnet blockchain node by executing the script in the base directory of the repository:

```bash
 ./qubetics_ubuntu_node.sh (it's for ubuntu os) 
```
:::info
Right Now qubetics binary is only for ubuntu22.04, ubuntu 24.04 
:::

The script stores the node configuration including the local default endpoints under `~/.tmp-qubeticsd/config/config.toml`.
If you have previously run the script, the script allows you to overwrite the existing configuration and start a new
local node.

Once your node is running you will see it syncing with testnet of qubetics and producing blocks in your local Qubetics blockchain:

```bash
12:59PM INF executed block height=1 module=state num_invalid_txs=0 num_valid_txs=0 server=node
# ...
1:00PM INF indexed block exents height=7 module=txindex server=node
```





## Mannually Initialize Testnet Node

We need to initialize the node to create all the necessary validator and node configuration files:

```bash
qubeticsd init <your_custom_moniker> --chain-id qubetics_9029-1
```

:::danger
Monikers can contain only ASCII characters. Using Unicode characters will render your node unreachable.
:::

By default, the `init` command creates your `~/.qubeticsd` (i.e `$HOME`) directory with subfolders `config/` and `data/`.
In the `config` directory, the most important files for configuration are `app.toml` and `config.toml`.

## Genesis & Seeds

### Copy the Genesis File

Check the `genesis.json` file from the [`archive`](https://github.com/Qubetics/qubetics-testnet-script/blob/main/genesis.json)
 and copy it over to the `config` directory: `~/.tmp-qubeticsd/config/genesis.json`. This is
 a genesis file with the chain-id and genesis accounts balances.

```bash
sudo apt install -y unzip wget
```

Then verify the correctness of the genesis configuration file:

```bash
qubeticsd validate-genesis
```

### Add Persistent Peers

We can set the [`persistent_peers`](https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.34/tendermint-core/using-tendermint.html#persistent-peer) field in `~/.tmp-qubeticsd/config/config.toml` to specify peers that your node will maintain persistent
 connections with. You can retrieve them from the list of
available peers on the [`testnet`](https://github.com/Qubetics/qubetics-testnet-script/blob/main/qubetics_ubuntu_node.sh) repo.

A list of available persistent peers is also available in the `#find-peers`. You can get a random 10 entries from the `peers.txt`
 file in the `PEERS` variable by running the following command:

```bash
PEERS=`b3262f53ab7bb3341807b853566a88415363bc42@114.119.184.52:26656,c4bd2d6b9b05cd2dc7e582d051168ffbdbcd4483@124.243.136.185:26656`
```

Use `sed` to include them into the configuration. You can also add them manually:

```bash
sed -i.bak -e "s/^persistent_peers *=.*/persistent_peers = \"$PEERS\"/" ~/.tmp-qubeticsd/config/config.toml
```

## Run a Testnet Validator


We have created a validator and delegator app so you can easily setup a validator and delegator node. Here is the link of our validator and delegator web app.

:::tip
[Valdiator web app](https://validator-testnet.qubetics.work/login)

[Delegator web app](https://delegator-testnet.qubetics.work/login)
:::

Claim your testnet <ProjectValue keyword="testnet_denom" />  on the [faucet](https://delegator-testnet.qubetics.work/faucet)
using your validator account address and submit your validator account address:

:::tip
For more details on how to run your validator, follow [these](./setup-and-configuration/run-a-validator) instructions.
:::

```bash
qubeticsd tx staking create-validator \
  --amount=1000000000000000000tics \
  --pubkey=$(qubeticsd tendermint show-validator) \
  --moniker="QubeticsWhale" \
  --chain-id=<chain_id> \
  --commission-rate="0.10" \
  --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
  --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
  --min-self-delegation="1000000" \
  --gas="auto" \
  --gas-prices="0.025tics" \
  --gas-adjustment="1.15" \
  --from=<key_name> \
  --home=$HOME/.tmp-qubeticsd
```

## Start testnet

The final step is to [start the nodes](./../protocol/qubetics-cli/).
Once enough voting power (+2/3) from the genesis validators is up-and-running, the
testnet will start producing blocks.

```bash
qubeticsd start
```

## Upgrading Your Node

:::tip
These instructions are for full nodes that have ran on previous versions of and would like to upgrade to the latest
 testnet version.
:::

### Reset Data

:::warning
If the version `<new_version>` you are upgrading to is not breaking from the previous one, you **should not** reset
the data. If this is the case you can skip to [Restart](#restart)
:::

First, remove the outdated files and reset the data.

```bash
rm $HOME/.tmp-qubeticsd/config/addrbook.json $HOME/.tmp-qubeticsd/config/genesis.json
qubeticsd tendermint unsafe-reset-all --home $HOME/.tmp-qubeticsd
```

Your node is now in a pristine state while keeping the original `priv_validator.json` and `config.toml`. If you had
 any sentry nodes or full nodes setup before,
your node will still try to connect to them, but may fail if they haven't also
been upgraded.

:::danger Warning
Make sure that every node has a unique `priv_validator.json`. Do not copy the `priv_validator.json`
from an old node to multiple new nodes. Running two nodes with the same `priv_validator.json`
will cause you to double sign.
:::

### Restart

To restart your node, just type:

```bash
qubeticsd start
```

## Share your Peer

:::tip
To get your Node ID use

```bash
qubeticsd tendermint show-node-id
```
